# Hacker Pack · HackUTD IX

# **Overview**

**🖥️ What is HackUTD?**

HackUTD is a weekend-long event where students build apps, hardware, and more. HackUTD provides a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with varying technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively build a unique solution from scratch. Whether you're a frequent hackathon attendee or just getting started, we'd love to see what you can make.

**💫 What's the Purpose?**

Develop CS & non-CS student relations and skills through hacking challenges. Showcase new technologies through workshops and facilitate meetings with industry leaders who choose to participate in our hackathon!

**🎉 Why attend HackUTD?**

HackUTD is a student organized hackathon aimed at offering fellow students an outlet for self expression and welcoming everyone with or without experience! HackUTD hosts events that introduce key concepts and relevant topics that new hackers will find useful.

# 👾 Discord

The HackUTD IX Discord can be found at [https://ix.hackutd.co/discord](https://ix.hackutd.co/discord). There will be channels for announcements, teambuilding, general discussion with fellow hackers, and contacting sponsors. However, we encourage hackers to interact in-person with other hackers and sponsors. Make sure to keep checking your dashboard at [https://ix.hackutd.co](https://ix.hackutd.co/) as well!

# 🌐 Wi-Fi

Our Wi-Fi network for the event is called “HackUTD” and should be available everywhere around ECS West! Please contact an organizer if you are having issues using the Wi-Fi in the building.

# **👯 Team Formation**

The maximum number of members in a team is 4. Don’t worry if you don’t have a team — a hackathon is a great place to meet new people! After the opening ceremony, we will have a teambuilding session where you can find people to hack with. Additionally, we will provide a teambuilding channel in Discord where you can find teammates.

# **💯 Submission & Judging**

Projects will be submitted to a platform called **[Devpost](https://hackutd-ix.devpost.com/)** — more details will be provided on the day of the event. Judging is done in-person. All teams will get a table to set up their project presentations, and judges will walk around to listen to your presentations. There will be a lot of projects, so we have allotted 3 hours to judging. This is where you can show off what you made and win the big prizes!

Sponsors will also have their judges walking around during general judging to judge your projects for their specific challenge. Be sure to impress them with your presentations to stand out among all the other submissions!
